# PythonProjectUnifier

This script should unify a whole python project into a single python source file, so it would be easier for you to run it everywhere without carry about dependencies and relative files and imports
This script relocate all the in a single python file, under classes, class for each module and python directory, and fix the import between them, if needed

# TODO
1. add to the output script a main, so it could run an individual module or script from the original project
2. fix imports and 'as' statements in them
